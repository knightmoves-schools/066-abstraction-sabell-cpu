Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects. (3B-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects. (3A-AP-17) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Explain how abstractions hide the underlying implementation details of computing systems embedded in everyday objects. (3A-CS-01) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
